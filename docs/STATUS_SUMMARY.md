## Extra Features (Not in PRD)

These features exist but weren't explicitly in the PRD:

1. ✅ **Web Scraping Framework** (~1,900 LOC) - Cookie-based authentication, rate limiting
2. ✅ **Shein Web Scraper** - Complete implementation with tests
3. ✅ **MAUI SheinCollector App** - Cookie capture tool

5. ✅ **Advanced Test Infrastructure** - Cross-platform test helpers
6. ✅ **Standalone GraphQL Client** - Reusable for MAUI/WASM

**Note**: PRD specified "ZIP file upload" for supplier data; implementation provides live web scraping as an alternative/enhancement.

## Key Metrics

- **Entities Implemented**: 14/14 (100%)
- **GraphQL Entity Coverage**: 1/7 entity types (14%)
- **UI Sections**: 1/7 major sections (14%)
- **PRD User Stories**: 1/9 (11%)
- **PRD Functional Requirements**: 2/8 sections (25%)
- **Test Pass Rate**: 35/36 tests passing (97%)

## Completion Perspective

Different ways to measure completion:

- **PRD Functional Requirements**: 19% (business workflow focus)
- **Development Effort**: 25% (includes infrastructure and architecture)
- **API Coverage**: 14% (entity types exposed)
- **UI Coverage**: 14% (major sections implemented)

---

## Bottom Line

✅ **Foundation is solid** - Data model complete, architecture excellent, technical infrastructure ready

❌ **Business logic missing** - Core workflows, reconciliation, reporting, and validation features not yet implemented

💡 **Ready for rapid development** - All architectural decisions made, database schema complete, just need to build the business layer and UI

📈 **Estimated completion**: 19-25% of PRD scope
- 19% when measured against PRD functional requirements
- 25% when including infrastructure and architectural effort
