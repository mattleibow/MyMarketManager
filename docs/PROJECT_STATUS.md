# My Market Manager - Project Status

**Last Updated**: October 23, 2025  
**Overall Completion**: 19-25% (19% PRD functional requirements, 25% including infrastructure)

---

## System Overview

**My Market Manager is a data aggregation and automation platform**, not a manual data entry system. The primary purpose is to **automatically consolidate external data** from web-scraped supplier orders and imported sales reports, with manual workflows serving as exception handling.

**Core Focus**:
- ✅ **Automated purchase order ingestion** via web scraping (Shein implemented)
- 🟡 **Automated sales data import** from payment providers (planned)
- 🟡 **Automated reconciliation** with intelligent matching (planned)
- ❌ **Manual data entry** is secondary for exceptions only

---

## Summary

**System Purpose**: Data aggregation and automation platform - **NOT a manual data entry system**

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Solid foundation with clean architecture
- ✅ Modern tech stack (.NET 10, EF Core 9, HotChocolate 15, Aspire)
- ✅ Complete data model with all entities
- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete: Purchase Order Automation via web scraping (~1,900 LOC)**
- ✅ 97% test pass rate (35/36)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

**Critical Gaps** (Missing Core Automation):
- ❌ **Phase 2: Sales Data Automation** - No CSV/API import or validation dashboard (CRITICAL)
- ❌ **Phase 3: Reconciliation Automation** - No fuzzy matching or auto-linking (CRITICAL)
- ❌ **Phase 2-3 Background Jobs** - No automated scheduling (HIGH)
- ❌ **Phase 3 Reporting** - No profit/performance dashboards (HIGH)

**Secondary Gaps** (Manual Workflows):
- ❌ Manual PO entry forms (Phase 5 - low priority, exception handling)
- ❌ Manual delivery recording (Phase 5 - low priority, exception handling)
- ❌ Manual stocktake UI (Phase 5 - low priority, exception handling)

**Current State Assessment**:
The system has **excellent infrastructure** (100% complete) and **Phase 1 complete** (purchase order automation via web scraping). However, **Phases 2 and 3 are missing entirely**, making the system currently function as a **manual data entry system** for sales rather than the intended **automated aggregation platform**.

**Next Steps**:
1. **Complete Phase 2** (Sales Data Automation) - Import and validation
2. **Complete Phase 3** (Reconciliation Automation) - Matching and reporting
3. **Complete Phase 4** (API Completion) - Support automation workflows
4. **Phase 5** (Manual Workflows) can wait until automation is proven

Do not implement manual workflows (Phase 5) until Phases 2 and 3 automation is complete. The value proposition is automation, not manual entry forms.

**Bottom Line**:
- **Infrastructure**: Production-ready ✅
- **Phase 1 (PO Automation)**: 100% complete ✅
- **Phase 2 (Sales Automation)**: 0% complete ❌
- **Phase 3 (Reconciliation)**: 0% complete ❌
- **Priority**: Complete Phases 2 and 3 (automation) before Phase 5 (manual workflows)
