# My Market Manager - Project Status

**Last Updated**: October 23, 2025  
**Overall Completion**: 19-25% (19% PRD functional requirements, 25% including infrastructure)

---

## System Overview

**My Market Manager is a data aggregation and automation platform**, not a manual data entry system. The primary purpose is to **automatically consolidate external data** from web-scraped supplier orders and imported sales reports, with manual workflows serving as exception handling.

**Core Focus**:
- ✅ **Automated purchase order ingestion** via web scraping (Shein implemented)
- 🟡 **Automated sales data import** from payment providers (planned)
- 🟡 **Automated reconciliation** with intelligent matching (planned)
- ❌ **Manual data entry** is secondary for exceptions only

## Completion Methodology

Different perspectives on project completion:

- **19%** - Based on PRD functional requirements (business workflow focus)
- **25%** - Based on development effort (includes infrastructure and architecture)
- **14%** - Based on API entity coverage (GraphQL completeness)
- **14%** - Based on UI section coverage (user interface completeness)

**Consensus**: Project is approximately **20%** complete with a strong foundation ready for rapid feature development.

## Summary

**System Purpose**: Data aggregation and automation platform - **NOT a manual data entry system**

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Solid foundation with clean architecture
- ✅ Modern tech stack (.NET 10, EF Core 9, HotChocolate 15, Aspire)
- ✅ Complete data model with all entities
- ✅ **Web scraping infrastructure for automated PO ingestion (~1,900 LOC)**
- ✅ 97% test pass rate (35/36)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

**Critical Gaps** (Missing Core Automation):
- ❌ **Automated sales import** - No CSV/API integration (CRITICAL)
- ❌ **Auto-reconciliation engine** - No fuzzy matching or auto-linking (CRITICAL)
- ❌ **Validation dashboard** - Cannot review unresolved items (CRITICAL)
- ❌ **Two-phase background jobs** - No automated ingestion scheduling (HIGH)
- ❌ **Automated reporting** - No profit/performance dashboards (HIGH)

**Secondary Gaps** (Manual Workflows):
- ❌ Manual PO entry forms (low priority - exception handling)
- ❌ Manual delivery recording (low priority - exception handling)
- ❌ Manual stocktake UI (low priority - exception handling)

**Current State Assessment**:
The system has **excellent infrastructure** (100% complete) but is missing **all 5 critical automation features**. This makes it currently function as a **manual data entry system** rather than the intended **automated aggregation platform**.

**Next Steps**:
Focus exclusively on **Phase 1 (Core Automation)**. Do not implement manual workflows (Phase 3) until automation is complete. The value proposition is automation, not manual entry forms.

**Bottom Line**:
- **Infrastructure**: Production-ready ✅
- **Automation (Primary Purpose)**: 20% complete (web scraping only) 🟡
- **Manual Workflows (Secondary)**: 5% complete (product CRUD only) 🟡
- **Priority**: Implement the 5 missing automation features in Phase 1 before anything else
