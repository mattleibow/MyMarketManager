## Completion Metrics Summary

Different perspectives on completion percentage:

- **PRD Functional Requirements**: ~19% (focus on business workflow implementation)
- **Development Effort**: ~25% (includes infrastructure, data model, and extra features)
- **Entity Type API Coverage**: 14% (1 of 7 core entity types exposed)
- **UI Workflow Coverage**: 14% (1 of 7 major sections implemented)

## Conclusion

My Market Manager has an **excellent technical foundation** with a complete data model, modern architecture, and innovative web scraping infrastructure (~1,900+ LOC). However, the **core business workflows** described in the PRD are largely unimplemented. 

**Estimated completion**: 19-25% depending on measurement methodology:
- 19% when measured against PRD functional requirements (business logic focus)
- 25% when including infrastructure, data model, and architectural decisions

The project is ready for rapid feature development - the hard architectural decisions are made, and the database schema is complete. The next phase should focus on building out the business logic layer and corresponding UI for each workflow in the PRD.

## Test Status Summary

- ✅ Data Layer: 14/14 tests passing
- ✅ Scraper Tests: 7/8 tests passing (1 skipped integration test)
- ✅ Integration Tests: 14/14 tests passing (requires `DCP_IP_VERSION_PREFERENCE=ipv4`)
- ✅ Build: Successful with 3 warnings (preview SDK, null reference, parameter capture)
